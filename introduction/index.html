    <h1 class="h1">hello world</h1>
    <p>
        Looking back now I didn't know what it was supposed to be
        And, and it's like raising' kids, man
        If you weren't raised, you don't know how to raise, you know?
        I just did the best thing I could with them because
        They know fucking well I love them
        But I didn't do the best I could
        I didn't know what the fuck I was doing
        I didn't
        I will never forget watching my mother get put in a straight jacket
        And taken out of my home when I was only seven years old
        She was diagnosed with dementia praecox and put in a mental institution
        Leaving my daddy alone with me and my little brother Lloyd
        I later had an evil stepmother
        Who further cemented the idea that I didn't need a mother
        Growing up without one
        Had long lasting impressions I didn't fully understand until much later in life
        It bled into my relationships with family
        And those I had become romantically involved with
        Whenever I got too close to a woman I would cut her off
        Part of that was vindictive and partially based on fear
        But it was also totally subconscious
        Looking back is a bitch, innit?
